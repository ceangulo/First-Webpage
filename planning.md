<h1>A Dog's Life at Home</h1>

I am Noni, name that my owners gave me after I was adopted and brough to home.
I am 10 years old Schnauzer. Living a dream life. I do not do much as I am getting older,
so at this age my life is similar to a retired human being.

A simple routine, I get up somewhat early as my mom does to. I like to keep her company.
Well she is not my real mom, as she is human but she adopted me and that is why I call her mom.

I got younger human siblings, who also take care of me, Not as often as I would like but they do.
I also have a human dad. He does a few things for me and he does not show that he likes me but I know he does.
